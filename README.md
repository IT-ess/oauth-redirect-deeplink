# Tauri Plugin Matrix-Svelte Deeplink redirect

If you don't know what this is, check out this [repo](https://github.com/IT-ess/tauri-plugin-matrix-svelte).

You can use this basic website to serve the required files for the deeplinks to work.
The `/auth-callback` will pass the OAuth confirmation code to your app with the deeplink scheme you defined in your app (and here).

## Env variables

Duplicate `.env.example` and rename it `.env`. Replace with the according values. These values must match the ones in your app.
